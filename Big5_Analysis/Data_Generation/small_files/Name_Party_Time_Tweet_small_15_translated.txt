2021-01-22T09: 14: 04.000Z After around 10 months (!) Pandemic, a #Corona surcharge should finally be added to the basic security. For #masks. Dear @hubertus_heil, please also consider the higher prices for groceries etc. € 100 for adults & € 60 for children. Everything else exacerbates poverty.

2020-11-17T13: 12: 20.000Z that's how it is! Lisa Paus @ lisapaus · Nov 17, 2020The #minijob trap is real and fatal for low-wage earners & many #women. Incentives are absurd. # Basic security & income tax have to be considered together. #Ehegattensplitting is abolished.

2020-11-04T09: 22: 48.000Z Bitter: In the Social Committee #Bundestag, CDUCSU + SPD have just pushed through their law on the standard rates in basic security. These are too low and cement poverty. We Greens will put our alternative concept to the vote in plenary tomorrow.
