1 Getting the data from Twitter
1.1 We searched for a list with twitter accounts of German politicians

1.3 Problem with the silenium browser extension because we simulated the behavior of normal twitter user. We were not able to buffer a huge amount of tweets.
1.4 For every politician we saved his data in an own CSV-file
