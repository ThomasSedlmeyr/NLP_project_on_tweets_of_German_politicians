1 Getting the data from Twitter
1.1 We searched for a list with twitter accounts of German politicians  
1.2 We decided to write our own scrap routine because of limitations of the twitter API
1.3 Problem with the silenium browser extension because we simulated the behavior of normal twitter user. We were not able to buffer a huge amount of tweets.
1.4 For every politician we saved his data in an own CSV-file
1.5 We had to clean our data because some politicians politicians had no party in the file we used and there were some other errors in the file MDB.csv 
1.6 There were many typos in the CSV file we found on the internet also the encoding of the umlauts was wrong
1.7 Translating the tweets directly as txt-file with Google Translate was not possible we had to copy them into word documents which destroyed the format
